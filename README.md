# Help Panel Component

This is a test module for distributing components using npm.

This package does not include the server code.

## Requirements for components

- Start with one component per Git project
- `README.md` describe component and API, CSS, usage, dependencies, todo, design requirements, development roadmap
- `CHANGELOG.md` lists releases and changes
- `package.json` all dependencies to build, test, and run demo app
- `/src` component source files including tests
- `/demo` standalone demo running on node/express using basic Angular application 

## Roadmap

As we develop more components we should be able to consolidate components into a single Git project. This project will form the basis of the component Kitchen sink.


## TODO

- Revise navigation (simple state management, think about number of levels)
- Content rendering
- Back navigation scroll position reset
